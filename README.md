👋 Hi, I’m @aiyojun

**👀 A senior developer, algorithm engineer and designer, and now responsible for product architecture.**

🌱 It has been long time for me researching computer technologies, including advanced program languages, underlying hardware, compilation mechanism, Linux kernel, ARM, software architecture, and designing of visual software about B/S and C/S architecture.

📝 The past three years, I have created many open source projects. Some of these are very valuable. And it was used in my work usually. If you have any interest in these projects, you can research some of them. 

💞️ In spite of joining github for five years, i still don't know how to introduce my projects to other developers. So sad~ 😔
